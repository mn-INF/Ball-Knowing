Location for SQL queries on the Shared Hoops Database for Accessible Querying (SHAQ)

While I was learning how to make queries in SQL, I downloaded a multiple tables of basketball data and combined them into a SQL database. 

The downloaded tables include:
- League seasons
- Leagues
- Player season stat totals
- Players
- Season types
- Team seasons
- Teams

This repository and the queries along with it are a fun take on working on new SQL queries to derive insights about NBA players and teams.
